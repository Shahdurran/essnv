## Overview

MDS AI Analytics is a comprehensive AI-powered business analytics dashboard designed for multi-location dermatology practice management. The platform provides real-time insights, forecasting, and natural language analytics queries through an AI business assistant powered by OpenAI GPT-4o. The application serves 5 demo practice locations and offers comprehensive analytics for both medical and cosmetic dermatology procedures, including revenue projections, patient volume analysis, insurance breakdown, and key performance indicators.

**Note:** This is now a generalized demo version with anonymized data, generic addresses (555 phone numbers), and "Dr. Example User" instead of specific practitioner information, making it suitable for broader demonstration purposes.
