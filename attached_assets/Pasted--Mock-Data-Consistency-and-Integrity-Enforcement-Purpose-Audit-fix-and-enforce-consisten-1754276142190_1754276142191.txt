# Mock Data Consistency and Integrity Enforcement

## Purpose  
Audit, fix, and enforce consistency across all mock data sources used throughout the dashboard. Ensure that all widgets reflect accurate, reconciled values that align with defined business logic and real-world expectations.

---

## Immediate Corrections

### 1. Revenue Alignment  
For each month, ensure the following equation holds true:

**Key Metric Trends (Total Revenue)**  
= **Insurance Claims Tracker → Submitted**  
+ **Patient Billing Analytics → Total Revenue (from Patient Payments)**

Adjust values if this equation does not hold.

### 2. Insurance Claims Tracker Totals  
Ensure that for every given time period and location:

**Submitted = Paid + Pending + Denied**

Fix any inconsistencies by recalculating the status totals.

## Additional Rules for Comprehensive Consistency

### 3. Revenue Composition Ratio  
Apply this rule across all time periods and widgets:

- **Patient Revenue** ≈ 20% of Total Revenue  
- **Insurance Revenue** ≈ 80% of Total Revenue

Applies to:
- Key Metric Trends  
- Revenue Charts  
- Practice Insights  
- Insurance Claims Tracker  
- Patient Billing Analytics

### 4. Location & Date Alignment  
Each mock data entry should include:
- A valid **date** within the expected filter range
- A valid **location** (used for location filters and breakdowns)

This ensures consistency when filtering across widgets.

### 5. Aging Bucket Accuracy  
Use actual dates to classify data into AR buckets:

- For insurance: use `submission_date`  
- For patient billing: use `statement_sent_date`

Aging buckets must be:
- 0–30 days  
- 31–60 days  
- 61–90 days  
- 90+ days

Ensure each item is placed correctly based on aging.

### 6. Avoid Double Counting Revenue  
- Do **not** count the same transaction in both insurance and patient datasets.  
- Patient and insurance revenue should be exclusive.  
- Each widget should pull from the correct dataset only.

---

### 7. Maintain Realistic Data Ranges  
Adjust mock data to follow these expectations:

- Insurance Claim Collection Rate: **70–98%**  
- Patient Payment Collection Rate: **60–90%**  
- Denial Rate: **10–20%** of submitted claims

Any values outside these ranges should be revised for realism.

## Final Instructions

- Validate all mock data sources against these rules  
- Correct any monthly totals, aging categories, or revenue calculations that don’t match  
- Normalize all datasets across:
  - Insurance Claims Tracker  
  - Revenue Charts  
  - Practice Insights  
  - Patient Billing Analytics  
  - AR Buckets
