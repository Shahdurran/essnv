## Mock Data Instructions

### 1. Enrich Mock Data for Patient Billing
- Create a separate dataset for **patient payments**, distinct from insurance revenue
- Include:
  - Payment date
  - Patient ID
  - Location
  - Payment method (optional)
  - Billed amount vs. collected amount
  - Outstanding balances
  - Date of statement sent
  - Reminder history (if any)

### 2. Ensure System-Wide Data Consistency
- All widgets should pull from **enriched mock datasets**
  - Insurance-based revenue widgets → use updated **insurance claim data**
  - Patient Billing widget → use **new patient payment data**
- Ensure consistency across:
  - Time periods
  - Locations
  - Procedure codes (if relevant)
