# New Feature: AR Buckets for Outstanding Claims Widget

## Purpose
Add a widget to display **Accounts Receivable (AR) aging buckets** for **outstanding insurance claims**. This will give the business owner visibility into the aging of unpaid claims by payers.

## Widget Requirements

### Metrics to Show:

**Title**: AR Buckets (Outstanding Claims)

**Display Format**:
- Horizontal or vertical bar chart (or clean list) showing:
  - `0–30 days`: $XX,XXX
  - `31–60 days`: $XX,XXX
  - `61–90 days`: $XX,XXX
  - `90+ days`: $XX,XXX

- Include **color coding** to visually represent urgency:
  - Green → 0–30
  - Yellow → 31–60
  - Orange → 61–90
  - Red → 90+

- Display total outstanding AR amount at the top or as a bold header (optional)

### Filters:
- Time frame alignment is **not necessary**, as AR buckets are always calculated based on current aging
- Ensure this widget supports **location-based filtering** like other components

## Layout Instructions

- Place this widget **beside** the updated Patient Billing Analytics widget on the dashboard
- Both widgets should be **half-width (50%)**
- These two widgets should be visually grouped to form a clean bottom row on the dashboard, below the Insurance Claims Tracker

## Mock Data Instructions

### 1. Create / Extend Insurance Claim Dataset
- Include mock claim entries with:
  - Submission date
  - Claim amount
  - Paid amount
  - Status (Pending / Denied / Paid)
  - Insurance provider
  - Location
- Use `submission date` to determine aging category:
  - 0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+

- Populate values that reflect realistic AR distributions (e.g., heavier concentration in 0–60 days, smaller in 90+)

### 2. Maintain Global Data Consistency
- This AR dataset must be aligned with the **insurance claim data** used in other components like:
  - Insurance Claims Tracker
  - Revenue Charts
  - Practice Insights

Ensure that **claim status and payment dates** are consistent across all mock datasets.
