/*
 * REACT APPLICATION ENTRY POINT
 * ==============================
 * 
 * This is the main entry file for our React frontend application.
 * It's responsible for mounting our React app to the HTML DOM.
 * 
 * MODERN REACT ARCHITECTURE:
 * This uses React 18's new "createRoot" API instead of the legacy ReactDOM.render().
 * The new API provides better performance and enables React 18 features like:
 * - Concurrent rendering (React can pause and resume work)
 * - Automatic batching (multiple setState calls are batched together)
 * - Suspense for data fetching
 * - Server-side streaming
 * 
 * FILE STRUCTURE CONTEXT:
 * This file sits at client/src/main.tsx and is the entry point defined in our
 * Vite configuration. When you run the development server, Vite:
 * 1. Loads this file first
 * 2. Follows all the import statements to build the dependency graph
 * 3. Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
 * 4. Bundles everything together
 * 5. Serves the resulting code to your browser

// Import React 18's new root API for mounting React components
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

// Import our main App component (the root of our component tree)
import App from "./App";

// Import global CSS styles that apply to the entire application
import "./index.css";

/*
 * REACT ROOT CREATION AND RENDERING
 * ==================================
 * 
 * This line does several important things:
 * 
 * 1. document.getElementById("root") finds the HTML element with id="root"
 *    - This element is defined in client/index.html
 *    - It's the "container" where our React app will be inserted
 * 
 * 2. The "!" is a TypeScript "non-null assertion operator"
 *    - We're telling TypeScript "I know this element exists, don't worry about null"
 *    - In a real app, you might want to add error handling here
 * 
 * 3. createRoot() creates a React "root" using the new React 18 API
 *    - This replaces the old ReactDOM.render() pattern
 *    - Enables concurrent features and better performance
 * 
 * 4. .render(<App />) mounts our App component into the root element
 *    - <App /> is JSX syntax that creates a React element
 *    - This starts the React rendering process and creates the virtual DOM
 * 
 * RESULT:
 * After this line executes, our entire React application is running in the browser,
 * with the App component as the root of the component tree.
