/*
 * SHARED SCHEMA DEFINITION FILE
 * ============================
 * 
 * This file defines the DATABASE SCHEMA and TYPE DEFINITIONS that are shared
 * between both the frontend (client) and backend (server) code.
 * 
 * WHAT IS A SCHEMA?
 * A schema is like a blueprint for your database - it defines what tables exist,
 * what columns each table has, what data types those columns store, and how
 * tables relate to each other.
 * 
 * WHY IS THIS SHARED?
 * By keeping the schema in a "shared" folder, both our frontend and backend
 * can import the exact same type definitions. This prevents bugs where the
 * frontend expects different data than the backend provides.
 * 
 * LIBRARIES USED:
 * - drizzle-orm: A TypeScript ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool that lets us
 *   define database schemas using TypeScript instead of raw SQL
 * - drizzle-zod: Automatically generates validation schemas from our database schema
 * - zod: A TypeScript-first schema validation library that ensures data is the right format
 */

/*
 * USERS TABLE DEFINITION
 * ======================
 * 
 * This table stores information about people who can log into the system.
 * In our medical practice app, this includes doctors, staff, and administrators.
 * 
 * TYPESCRIPT/DRIZZLE SYNTAX EXPLANATION:
 * - `export const users = pgTable(...)` creates a PostgreSQL table definition
 * - `pgTable` is a Drizzle function that defines a PostgreSQL table
 * - The first parameter "users" is the actual table name in the database
 * - The second parameter is an object defining all the columns
 * 
 * COLUMN EXPLANATIONS:
 * - id: A unique identifier for each user (UUID = Universally Unique Identifier)
 *   - varchar("id") = variable-length character field
 *   - .primaryKey() = this column uniquely identifies each row
 *   - .default(sql`gen_random_uuid()`) = automatically generate a random UUID when creating new users
 * 
 * - username: The login name (like "dr.smith" or "jane.nurse")
 *   - text("username") = unlimited length text field
 *   - .notNull() = this field is required, cannot be empty
 *   - .unique() = no two users can have the same username
 * 
 * - password: Encrypted password for login security
 *   - In a real app, this would be hashed/encrypted, never stored as plain text
 * 
 * - name: The person's real name (like "Dr. Sarah Smith")
 * 
 * - role: What type of user this is
 *   - Could be "practice_owner", "staff", "admin", etc.
 *   - Used to control what parts of the app they can access
 * 
 * - practiceId: Links this user to a specific medical practice
 *   - Some users might work at multiple practices, others just one

});

/*
 * PRACTICE LOCATIONS TABLE
 * ========================
 * 
 * This table stores information about each physical office/clinic location.
 * Our demo practice has 5 locations across different states.
 * 
 * WHY SEPARATE LOCATIONS?
 * Medical practices often have multiple offices. Each location might have:
 * - Different staff members
 * - Different equipment and capabilities  
 * - Different patient volumes and revenue
 * - Different insurance contracts and rates
 * 
 * Our analytics need to show data both by individual location AND combined across all locations.
 * 
 * COLUMN DETAILS:
 * - name: Short identifier like "Manhattan, NY" or "Fresno, CA"
 * - address/city/state/zipCode: Full address information for the clinic
 * - phone: Contact number for this specific location
 * - isActive: boolean (true/false) field to mark if location is currently operating
 *   - .default(true) means new locations are active unless specified otherwise
 *   - This lets us "soft delete" locations by marking them inactive instead of removing data
 */

/*
 * PATIENTS TABLE
 * ==============
 * 
 * Stores basic information about each patient in the practice.
 * This is carefully designed to respect medical privacy laws (HIPAA).
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: MEDICAL DATA PRIVACY
 * In a real medical application, this data would be:
 * - Encrypted at rest and in transit
 * - Access-controlled (only authorized staff can view)
 * - Audit-logged (track who accessed what patient data when)
 * - Regularly backed up with strong security
 * 
 * FOREIGN KEY RELATIONSHIP:
 * - locationId references practiceLocations.id
 * - This creates a "relationship" between tables
 * - Each patient is associated with a specific practice location
 * - .references(() => practiceLocations.id) tells the database to enforce this relationship
 * 
 * TIMESTAMP DATA TYPES:
 * - timestamp stores both date and time (like "2025-01-15 14:30:00")
 * - .defaultNow() automatically sets the current date/time when creating a new record
 * - Useful for tracking when patients first joined the practice
 * 
 * DATA ANALYTICS PURPOSE:
 * This patient data enables analytics like:
 * - Patient volume trends over time
 * - Demographics analysis
 * - Insurance provider breakdowns
 * - Location-based patient distribution
 */

/*
 * PROCEDURES TABLE  
 * ================
 * 
 * This table defines all the medical procedures that the practice can perform.
 * Each procedure has billing codes, pricing, and categorization information.
 * 
 * MEDICAL BILLING CONCEPTS:
 * - CPT Code: "Current Procedural Terminology" - standardized codes for medical procedures
 *   - Example: "99213" = Established patient office visit, moderate complexity
 *   - Example: "17110" = Destruction of benign or premalignant lesion
 *   - These are universal codes used across all US healthcare for billing insurance
 * 
 * - RVU: "Relative Value Unit" - a measure of the resources required for a procedure
 *   - Used by Medicare and insurance companies to determine reimbursement rates
 *   - Higher RVU = more complex/time-consuming procedure = higher reimbursement
 * 
 * DECIMAL DATA TYPE EXPLANATION:
 * - decimal(10, 2) means: up to 10 total digits, with 2 digits after the decimal point
 *   - So basePrice could store values like: 1234567.89 (10 digits total, 2 after decimal)
 *   - This is better than regular numbers for money because it avoids rounding errors
 * 
 * - decimal(8, 4) for RVU means: up to 8 total digits, 4 after decimal
 *   - Example: 1234.5678 (precise measurement for government reimbursement calculations)
 * 
 * CATEGORY FIELD:
 * - "medical": Essential healthcare (skin cancer removal, rash treatment, etc.)
 * - "cosmetic": Elective appearance improvements (Botox, chemical peels, etc.)
 * - Important distinction for insurance (medical is usually covered, cosmetic often isn't)

/*
 * PATIENT VISITS TABLE
 * ====================
 * 
 * This is the "transaction" table that records each time a patient comes to the clinic.
 * Each visit can include multiple procedures and generates revenue for the practice.
 * 
 * MULTIPLE FOREIGN KEY RELATIONSHIPS:
 * - patientId: Links to the patients table (which patient had this visit?)
 * - locationId: Links to practiceLocations table (which office was this visit at?)
 * - Having both references lets us analyze data by patient AND by location
 * 
 * VISIT TYPES IN MEDICAL BILLING:
 * - "new_patient": First time this patient has been seen by this practice
 *   - Insurance typically pays more for new patient visits (more time needed)
 * - "established_patient": Patient has been seen before (follow-up, routine care)
 *   - Usually shorter visits, lower reimbursement rates
 * 
 * REVENUE TRACKING FIELDS:
 * - totalRevenue: The total amount charged for this visit (all procedures combined)
 * - insurancePaid: How much the insurance company actually paid
 * - patientPaid: How much the patient paid out-of-pocket (copays, deductibles, etc.)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP:
 * totalRevenue = insurancePaid + patientPaid + (amount still owed or written off)
 * 
 * STATUS FIELD FOR OPERATIONAL TRACKING:
 * - "scheduled": Appointment is booked but hasn't happened yet
 * - "completed": Visit occurred and was properly documented  
 * - "cancelled": Patient cancelled before the visit
 * - "no_show": Patient didn't show up for scheduled appointment
 * 
 * WHY TRACK NO-SHOWS AND CANCELLATIONS?
 * - Helps identify scheduling patterns and patient behavior
 * - Important for operational efficiency (wasted time slots = lost revenue)
 * - Some practices charge fees for excessive no-shows
 */

/*
 * VISIT PROCEDURES TABLE (JUNCTION/BRIDGE TABLE)
 * ==============================================
 * 
 * This table connects patient visits with the specific procedures performed during each visit.
 * This is called a "junction table" or "bridge table" because it connects two other tables.
 * 
 * WHY DO WE NEED THIS SEPARATE TABLE?
 * A single patient visit might include multiple procedures:
 * - Example: Patient comes in for skin cancer screening
 *   - Procedure 1: Initial consultation (CPT 99213)
 *   - Procedure 2: Biopsy of suspicious mole (CPT 11100)  
 *   - Procedure 3: Liquid nitrogen treatment of wart (CPT 17110)
 * 
 * Without this table, we'd have to either:
 * - Limit visits to one procedure each (bad for business and patient care)
 * - Store multiple procedures in a single field (makes queries very difficult)
 * 
 * MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIP:
 * - One visit can have many procedures
 * - One procedure type can be performed in many different visits
 * - This table creates a "many-to-many" relationship between visits and procedures
 * 
 * FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES:
 * - visitId: Which specific patient visit was this procedure part of?
 * - procedureId: Which type of procedure was performed?
 * 
 * BILLING AND INSURANCE TRACKING:
 * - quantity: How many times was this procedure performed? (e.g., 3 biopsies)
 * - chargedAmount: What was the total charge for this procedure?
 * - paidAmount: How much was actually collected from insurance/patient?
 * - insuranceClaimDate: When was the claim submitted to insurance?
 * - insurancePaidDate: When did insurance actually pay?
 * 
 * ANALYTICS VALUE:
 * This detailed tracking enables sophisticated business intelligence:
 * - Which procedures are most profitable?
 * - How long does it take insurance companies to pay?
 * - What's the collection rate for different procedure types?
 * - Which procedures are growing/declining in volume?
 */

/*
 * AI QUERIES TABLE
 * ================
 * 
 * This table stores conversations between users and our AI business assistant.
 * It serves multiple purposes: user experience, analytics, and system improvement.
 * 
 * PURPOSE AND BENEFITS:
 * 1. CONVERSATION HISTORY: Users can see their previous questions and answers
 * 2. ANALYTICS: Track what users are asking about most (popular questions)
 * 3. SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT: Identify common queries to build better features
 * 4. AUDIT TRAIL: Track who asked what when (important for medical compliance)
 * 
 * FIELD EXPLANATIONS:
 * - userId: Which user asked this question? (links to users table)
 * - query: The actual question the user typed (e.g., "What's our revenue trend?")
 * - response: The AI's answer to the question
 * - queryType: Category of question for analytics
 *   - "forecast": Questions about future predictions
 *   - "revenue_analysis": Questions about financial performance
 *   - "patient_volume": Questions about patient numbers and trends
 *   - "comparative": Questions comparing locations or time periods
 * 
 * MODERN AI APPLICATION PATTERN:
 * This follows a common pattern in AI applications where you store both:
 * - The raw conversation (for user experience)
 * - Structured metadata (for analytics and improvement)
 * 
 * PRIVACY AND COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - No patient names or PHI (Protected Health Information) should be stored here
 * - Only aggregate data and business intelligence queries
 * - Helps demonstrate to auditors that patient privacy is protected

/*
 * PERFORMANCE METRICS TABLE
 * =========================
 * 
 * This table stores calculated business metrics over time. Think of it as a "data warehouse"
 * for pre-calculated analytics that would be expensive to compute on-demand.
 * 
 * WHY PRE-CALCULATE METRICS?
 * Instead of calculating "monthly revenue" every time someone loads the dashboard,
 * we calculate it once per day/week/month and store the result here. This makes
 * the dashboard load much faster, especially with lots of historical data.
 * 
 * FLEXIBLE DESIGN APPROACH:
 * This table uses a "key-value" pattern where:
 * - metricType describes what we're measuring
 * - value stores the calculated number
 * - metricDate stores when this measurement was taken
 * 
 * EXAMPLE METRIC TYPES:
 * - "monthly_revenue": Total revenue for a specific month
 * - "patient_count": Number of patients seen in a period
 * - "ar_days": Average days to collect payment (Accounts Receivable)
 * - "clean_claim_rate": Percentage of insurance claims paid without issues
 * - "no_show_rate": Percentage of appointments where patients didn't show up
 * 
 * JSON FIELD FOR COMPLEX DATA:
 * - additionalData uses PostgreSQL's native JSON support
 * - Can store complex objects like: {"by_insurance": {"BlueCross": 45000, "Aetna": 32000}}
 * - Allows flexibility without creating new columns for every possible breakdown
 * 
 * PRECISION FOR FINANCIAL DATA:
 * - decimal(15, 2) can store very large financial values accurately
 * - 15 total digits, 2 after decimal: up to $999,999,999,999.99
 * - Critical for medical practices with multi-million dollar annual revenue
 * 
 * TIME-SERIES ANALYTICS:
 * By storing metrics with timestamps, we can:
 * - Track trends over time ("Revenue is up 15% compared to last year")
 * - Create forecasts based on historical patterns
 * - Identify seasonal variations (cosmetic procedures peak in spring/summer)

/*
 * VALIDATION SCHEMAS FOR DATA INSERTION
 * =====================================
 * 
 * These lines create "validation schemas" using the Zod library. They ensure that
 * data is properly formatted before it gets saved to the database.
 * 
 * WHAT IS ZOD?
 * Zod is a TypeScript library that validates data at runtime. It can check:
 * - Is this field a string or number?
 * - Is this email address format valid?
 * - Is this required field actually provided?
 * - Is this number within acceptable ranges?
 * 
 * WHY USE createInsertSchema()?
 * - createInsertSchema() automatically generates validation rules from our database schema
 * - If the database says a field is "text().notNull()", Zod will require a non-empty string
 * - If the database says "decimal(10,2)", Zod will ensure it's a valid decimal number
 * - This prevents bugs where frontend sends invalid data to the backend
 * 
 * WHY .omit({ id: true })?
 * - When creating new records, we usually don't provide the ID
 * - The database generates the ID automatically (using gen_random_uuid())
 * - .omit({ id: true }) removes the ID field from the validation requirements
 * - For some schemas, we also omit createdAt because it's set automatically
 * 
 * TYPESCRIPT INTEGRATION:
 * These schemas work together with TypeScript to provide:
 * - Compile-time type checking (catches errors while coding)
 * - Runtime validation (catches errors when the app is running)
 * - IntelliSense autocompletion in code editors

/*
 * TYPESCRIPT TYPE DEFINITIONS
 * ===========================
 * 
 * These lines create TypeScript types that our frontend and backend can use.
 * Having shared types prevents bugs where different parts of the app expect different data formats.
 * 
 * TWO TYPES PER TABLE:
 * For each database table, we create two TypeScript types:
 * 
 * 1. SELECT TYPE (e.g., "User"): 
 *    - Represents data as it comes FROM the database
 *    - Includes all fields, including auto-generated ones (id, createdAt, etc.)
 *    - Used when displaying data to users
 * 
 * 2. INSERT TYPE (e.g., "InsertUser"):
 *    - Represents data as it goes TO the database  
 *    - Excludes auto-generated fields (no id, no createdAt)
 *    - Used when creating new records
 * 
 * DRIZZLE SYNTAX EXPLANATION:
 * - `typeof users.$inferSelect` means: "Look at the 'users' table definition and 
 *   automatically create a TypeScript type that includes all its columns"
 * - `z.infer<typeof insertUserSchema>` means: "Look at the Zod validation schema
 *   and automatically create a TypeScript type based on what fields it expects"
 * 
 * BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH:
 * - If we change the database schema, TypeScript types update automatically
 * - No need to manually maintain separate type definitions
 * - Compiler will catch mismatches between database and code immediately
 * - IntelliSense shows available fields when coding
 * 
 * EXAMPLE USAGE:
 * ```typescript
 * // When fetching a user from database:
 * const user: User = await database.getUser(id);
 * 
 * // When creating a new user:
 * const newUserData: InsertUser = {
 *   username: "jane.doe",
 *   password: "hashedPassword",
 *   name: "Jane Doe",
 *   role: "staff"
 * };

 * =============================
 * 
 * This interface defines how procedure performance data is structured for the

 * 
 * UNION TYPE EXPLANATION:
 * - category: 'medical' | 'cosmetic' is a TypeScript "union type"
 * - This means category can ONLY be the string "medical" OR the string "cosmetic"
 * - Any other value will cause a TypeScript error
 * - This prevents bugs like accidentally setting category to "medicle" (typo)
 * 
 * FIELD PURPOSE:
 * - cptCode: The standardized procedure code (e.g., "99213")
 * - description: Human-readable name (e.g., "Botox Injection")
 * - category: Whether it's medical treatment or cosmetic enhancement
 * - revenue: Total revenue generated by this procedure in the selected time period
 * - growth: Percentage change compared to previous period (e.g., "+15%")
 * - basePrice: What the practice charges for this procedure (formatted string like "$450")
 * - monthlyVolume: Average number of times this procedure is performed per month
 * 
 * BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE USE:
 * This data helps practice owners understand:
 * - Which procedures are most profitable
 * - Whether procedure volumes are growing or declining

/*
 * INSURANCE PAYER DATA INTERFACE
 * ==============================
 * 
 * This interface structures data about insurance companies and their payment patterns.
 * Used in charts showing insurance mix and accounts receivable analysis.
 * 
 * MEDICAL PRACTICE CONTEXT:
 * Medical practices work with many different insurance companies, each with
 * different payment rates, timeframes, and requirements.
 * 
 * FIELD EXPLANATIONS:
 * - name: Insurance company name (e.g., "Blue Cross Blue Shield", "Aetna", "Medicare")
 * - percentage: What percent of practice revenue comes from this insurance company
 * - arDays: Average days it takes this insurance company to pay claims
 * - revenue: Total revenue amount from this insurance company
 * - claimRate: What percentage of claims this insurance approves/pays (some deny more than others)
 * - color: Hex color code for consistent chart visualization (e.g., "#3B82F6")
 * 
 * BUSINESS ANALYTICS VALUE:
 * This helps practice owners:
 * - Identify which insurance companies are slow to pay (high arDays)
 * - See which insurers provide the most revenue
 * - Spot problem payers that deny claims frequently
 * - Make decisions about which insurance contracts to accept/renew
 * 
 * WHY AR DAYS MATTER:
 * "AR Days" (Accounts Receivable Days) is critical for cash flow:
 * - 30 days = excellent (insurance pays quickly)
 * - 45-60 days = typical for most insurance companies
 * - 90+ days = problematic (may indicate billing issues or difficult payer)

/*
 * PROJECTION DATA INTERFACE
 * =========================
 * 
 * This interface defines the structure for future predictions/forecasts.
 * Used by AI-powered forecasting components to show expected business trends.
 * 
 * FORECASTING IN HEALTHCARE:
 * Medical practices need to predict future performance for:
 * - Staffing decisions (hire more doctors/nurses?)
 * - Facility planning (need more exam rooms?)
 * - Financial planning (will we meet revenue targets?)
 * - Equipment purchases (can we afford new laser equipment?)
 * 
 * CONFIDENCE LEVELS EXPLAINED:
 * - confidenceLevel: Number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.85 = 85% confident)
 * - Higher confidence = more reliable prediction
 * - Lower confidence = prediction could vary significantly
 * - Based on factors like historical data quality, seasonal variations, etc.
 * 
 * FIELD PURPOSES:
 * - month/monthName/date: When this prediction applies
 * - projectedPatients: Expected number of patients for this period
 * - projectedRevenue: Expected revenue amount
 * - growthRate: Expected growth compared to same period last year (e.g., "+12%")
 * - confidenceLevel: How reliable this prediction is (0.0 to 1.0)
 * 
 * AI/ML INTEGRATION:
 * These projections typically come from machine learning models that analyze:
 * - Historical patient volume patterns
 * - Seasonal trends (cosmetic procedures peak in spring/summer)
 * - Economic indicators affecting healthcare spending
 * - Local competition and market changes

/*
 * KEY METRICS INTERFACE
 * =====================
 * 
 * This interface defines the core performance indicators displayed prominently
 * on the dashboard. These are the most important numbers practice owners check daily.
 * 
 * WHAT ARE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)?
 * KPIs are specific, measurable values that indicate how well a business is
 * performing against its goals. For medical practices, these metrics directly
 * relate to patient care quality and financial health.
 * 
 * METRIC EXPLANATIONS:
 * 
 * - monthlyPatients: Total patients seen this month
 *   * Indicates practice capacity and demand
 *   * Higher = more revenue potential, but need adequate staffing
 * 
 * - monthlyRevenue: Total revenue generated this month
 *   * Most direct measure of financial performance
 *   * Combines patient volume × average revenue per visit
 * 
 * - arDays: Average days to collect payment (Accounts Receivable Days)
 *   * Critical for cash flow management
 *   * Lower is better (faster payment = better cash flow)
 *   * Industry benchmark: 30-45 days is good, 60+ days needs attention
 * 
 * - cleanClaimRate: Percentage of insurance claims paid on first submission
 *   * Measures billing efficiency and accuracy
 *   * Higher is better (less rework, faster payment)
 *   * Target: 85%+ clean claim rate
 * 
 * - patientGrowth: Percent change in patient volume vs previous period
 *   * Shows whether practice is growing or shrinking
 *   * Format: "+8%" or "-3%"
 * 
 * - revenueGrowth: Percent change in revenue vs previous period
 *   * Overall financial performance trend
 *   * Should correlate with patient growth but can differ due to procedure mix
 * 
 * WHY STRING FORMAT FOR GROWTH?
 * Growth rates are stored as strings ("+8%") rather than numbers (0.08) because:
 * - Easier to display directly in UI components
 * - Includes sign (+ or -) and percentage symbol
 * - Avoids formatting calculations in multiple places

/*
 * POPULAR QUESTION INTERFACE
 * ==========================
 * 
 * This interface defines the structure for pre-defined questions that users
 * can quickly ask the AI assistant. Improves user experience by providing
 * common question templates.
 * 
 * USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN:
 * Rather than making users type questions from scratch, we provide popular
 * questions they can click on. This:
 * - Reduces typing and potential typos
 * - Shows users what kinds of questions the AI can answer
 * - Provides consistent wording for better AI understanding
 * - Speeds up interaction for common business questions
 * 
 * FIELD EXPLANATIONS:
 * - id: Unique identifier for tracking which questions are clicked most
 * - question: The actual question text (e.g., "What's our revenue trend this quarter?")
 * - icon: Lucide React icon name for visual representation (e.g., "TrendingUp")
 * - category: Groups related questions (e.g., "revenue", "patients", "forecasting")
 * - usage: Optional counter for how often this question is clicked
 * 
 * ANALYTICS AND IMPROVEMENT:
 * By tracking usage statistics, we can:
 * - Identify which questions are most valuable to users
 * - Reorganize questions based on popularity
 * - Add new questions based on common user patterns
 * - Remove questions that are never used
 * 
 * ICON INTEGRATION:
 * Icons help users quickly identify question types:
 * - TrendingUp: Growth and performance questions
 * - Users: Patient volume questions  
 * - DollarSign: Revenue and financial questions
 * - Calendar: Time-based and scheduling questions

/*
 * CHAT MESSAGE INTERFACE
 * ======================
 * 
 * This interface defines the structure for individual messages in the AI chat conversation.
 * Supports both user questions and AI responses with rich metadata.
 * 
 * CONVERSATIONAL AI DESIGN:
 * Modern AI assistants work best with conversational interfaces where users can:
 * - Ask questions in natural language
 * - See conversation history
 * - Get contextual responses with data and recommendations
 * 
 * UNION TYPE FOR MESSAGE TYPES:
 * - type: 'user' | 'ai' restricts values to exactly these two strings
 * - 'user': Messages typed by the human user
 * - 'ai': Responses generated by the AI assistant
 * 
 * CORE MESSAGE FIELDS:
 * - id: Unique identifier for each message (useful for React key props)
 * - content: The actual message text
 * - timestamp: When this message was created (for display and sorting)
 * 
 * OPTIONAL METADATA FIELDS:
 * - isWelcome: Marks initial greeting messages from AI
 * - isError: Indicates when something went wrong (API failures, etc.)
 * - queryType: Categorizes the type of question for analytics
 * - recommendations: Array of suggested follow-up questions or actions
 * - metrics: Key-value pairs of relevant data (e.g., {"revenue": "$245K", "growth": "+8%"})
 * 
 * RECORD TYPE EXPLANATION:
 * - Record<string, string | number> means an object where:
 *   - Keys are strings (the metric names)
 *   - Values can be either strings or numbers
 *   - Example: {"monthlyRevenue": 245000, "growthRate": "+8%"}
 * 
 * ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE:
 * Rich metadata enables:
 * - Highlighting important metrics in chat bubbles
 * - Providing contextual follow-up suggestions
 * - Graceful error handling with helpful messages
 * - Different styling for different message types

/*
 * INSURANCE CLAIM INTERFACE
 * =========================
 * 
 * This interface represents individual insurance claims submitted for payment.
 * Used for tracking claim status and managing accounts receivable.
 * 
 * MEDICAL BILLING WORKFLOW:
 * When a patient receives treatment:
 * 1. Practice provides medical services
 * 2. Practice submits claim to patient's insurance company
 * 3. Insurance reviews claim (may approve, deny, or request more info)
 * 4. Insurance pays approved claims (usually partial payment)
 * 5. Patient is billed for remaining balance (deductibles, copays, etc.)
 * 
 * CLAIM STATUS MEANINGS:
 * - 'Pending': Claim has been submitted, waiting for insurance response
 * - 'Submitted': More specific status showing claim is in insurance system
 * - 'Denied': Insurance refused to pay (could be coding error, coverage issue, etc.)
 * 
 * NOTE ON STATUS DESIGN:
 * In this interface, we're using 'Submitted' and 'Pending' which might seem redundant.
 * This allows for future expansion where we could have more granular statuses like:
 * - 'Draft' (not yet submitted)
 * - 'Submitted' (sent to insurance)
 * - 'Under Review' (insurance is processing)
 * - 'Pending Documentation' (insurance needs more info)
 * 
 * FIELD EXPLANATIONS:
 * - id: Unique identifier for this specific claim
 * - locationId: Which practice location performed the service
 * - insuranceProvider: Name of insurance company (e.g., "Blue Cross")
 * - claimAmount: Dollar amount being claimed from insurance
 * - patientId: Links to the patient who received treatment
 * - cptCode: Procedure code that was performed
 * - dateSubmitted: When the claim was sent to insurance
 * - denialReason: If denied, why (e.g., "Service not covered", "Missing documentation")
 * - dateCreated: When this claim record was first created in our system

/*
 * CLAIMS BREAKDOWN INTERFACE
 * ==========================
 * 
 * This interface structures aggregated claims data for dashboard displays.
 * Instead of showing individual claims, this shows summaries by status and provider.
 * 
 * PURPOSE FOR AGGREGATION:
 * - Individual claims would be overwhelming (hundreds/thousands per month)
 * - Practice owners need high-level insights, not detailed transaction lists
 * - Aggregated data loads faster and is easier to visualize in charts
 * 
 * NESTED OBJECT STRUCTURE:
 * The 'providers' field contains an array of objects with specific properties.
 * This inline object definition (not a separate interface) keeps related data together:
 * 
 * providers: {
 *   name: string;        // Insurance company name
 *   claimCount: number;  // How many claims for this status/provider combination
 *   amount: number;      // Total dollar amount for these claims
 * }[]
 * 
 * The '[]' at the end means this is an array of these objects.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE DATA STRUCTURE:
 * {
 *   status: 'Pending',
 *   totalClaims: 156,
 *   totalAmount: 89500,
 *   providers: [
 *     { name: 'Blue Cross', claimCount: 45, amount: 32000 },
 *     { name: 'Aetna', claimCount: 38, amount: 28500 },
 *     { name: 'Medicare', claimCount: 73, amount: 29000 }
 *   ]
 * }
 * 
 * BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE USE:
 * This structure enables analysis like:
 * - Which insurance companies have the most pending claims?
 * - What's the total dollar amount at risk from denied claims?
 * - Which payers are creating bottlenecks in our cash flow?
